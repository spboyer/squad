## 2026-02-09T0846 — Kobayashi: Branch strategy + release workflow

**Agent:** Kobayashi (Git & Release Engineer)
**Mode:** sync
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Output
- Renamed `squadify` → `dev` (local)
- Created `.github/workflows/release.yml` — filtered-copy pipeline (dev → main, product files only)
- Updated Proposal 021 with new branch strategy
- Chose filtered-copy approach over force-push, orphan, or gitattributes

### Key design decisions
- `main` is product-only: index.js, package.json, squad.agent.md, templates/, README, LICENSE
- `.ai-team/`, `docs/`, `test/`, orchestration logs NEVER reach main
- Release trigger: workflow_dispatch (manual) or tag push (v*)
- Version validated against package.json — mismatches abort
- Pre-release flag auto-set for 0.x versions

### Outputs
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/kobayashi-branch-strategy.md`
- `.ai-team/agents/kobayashi/history.md` (appended)
- `docs/proposals/021-release-plan-and-distribution.md` (updated)
