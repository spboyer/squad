# Orchestration Log Entry

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-08T05:08:26Z
**Agent:** Kujan
**Role:** Copilot SDK Expert
**Mode:** sync
**Requested by:** bradygaster

## Why Chosen
Brady asked about human input latency and Scribe-as-human-listener. Platform feasibility question — Kujan's domain.

## Files Produced
- .ai-team/agents/kujan/history.md (appended)
- .ai-team/decisions/inbox/kujan-human-input-analysis.md (new)

## Outcome
✅ Success. Input latency is a hard platform limitation (single-threaded coordinator). Human directives as state is fully solvable today via coordinator writing to inbox. Scribe-as-listener is wrong abstraction — coordinator should write directly.
