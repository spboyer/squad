# Orchestration Log: McManus (DevRel)

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Agent:** McManus (DevRel)  
**Mode:** background  
**Status:** Complete  

## Issue #105: Documentation + Test Updates

**Description:** Update documentation and test suite for `.ai-team/` → `.squad/` directory rename.

**Work Done:**

### Documentation Files
- **README.md**: Updated 7 references to `.squad/` (directory structure diagram, agent removal note, upgrade safety note, insider state note, label sync trigger, workflow table reference, server error recovery note)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated 9 references (branch diagram, branch purpose table, protected files explanation, guard workflow description, PR fixing instructions, quick reference diagram, FAQ responses, summary section)

### Test Files
- **test/init-flow.test.js**: Updated 3 assertions to reference `.squad/` path patterns
- **test/plugin-marketplace.test.js**: Updated 2 assertions for `.squad/plugins/` state storage location

### New Documentation
- **docs/migration/v0.5.0-squad-rename.md**: Comprehensive 400+ line migration guide including:
  - What changed at a glance (table)
  - Pre-migration checklist
  - Step-by-step migration process (3 steps)
  - Email scrubbing details (what's removed vs. preserved)
  - Git history note (git filter-repo for full cleanup)
  - Backward compatibility (v0.5.0-v0.6.0 transition period)
  - Gradual migration strategy
  - Troubleshooting (5 Q&A sections)
  - Post-migration verification
  - Deprecation timeline (v0.4.x → v1.0.0)

**Testing:** All tests pass: 53/53 ✅

**Key Messaging:** Migration guide is primary user communication — published as discoverable docs, not buried in upgrade command output. Backward compat is explicit: v0.5.0-v0.6.0 support both; migration required in v1.0.0.

**Result:** PR #113 opened (combined with Verbal's #102)
