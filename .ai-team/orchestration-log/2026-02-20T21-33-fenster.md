# Orchestration Log: Fenster (Core Dev)

**Agent:** Fenster  
**Date/Time:** 2026-02-20T21:33  
**Mode:** background  
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4.5  

## Why Chosen

Implementation feasibility analysis of memory architecture proposal. Fenster is responsible for core engineering and file system integration.

## Files Read

- Current Squad file structure (.ai-team/ layout)
- Proposal file paths and formats
- Windows/JSONL compatibility context

## Files Produced

- `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/fenster-memory-architecture-review.md`

## Outcome

Mapped proposal concepts to existing Squad files (charter = identity/me.md, history learnings = wisdom.md, orchestration-log = episodic memory). Flagged concrete blockers: JSONL on Windows (file locking, git merge conflicts, line endings), decisions.md already 300KB (~75K tokens). Recommended MVP: wisdom.md + now.md (~9 hours work, ships v0.6.0). Verdict: solutions exist (tag-based filtering + recency sorting instead of RAG, markdown instead of JSONL, .squad/ instead of repo root).
