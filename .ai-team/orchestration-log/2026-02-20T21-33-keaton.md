# Orchestration Log: Keaton (Lead)

**Agent:** Keaton  
**Date/Time:** 2026-02-20T21:33  
**Mode:** background  
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4.5 (bumped for architecture)  

## Why Chosen

Architectural review required for external memory architecture proposal. Keaton (Lead) is responsible for technology direction and architecture decisions.

## Files Read

- Internal context: Squad memory architecture (charters, history patterns)
- v0.5.0 scope documentation (rename + consolidation)
- Proposal details from Brady

## Files Produced

- `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/keaton-memory-architecture-review.md`

## Outcome

Analyzed overlap with existing Squad structure. Recommended cherry-picking wisdom.md + now.md for v0.6.0, deferring social modeling and RAG. Verdict: directionally right but overengineered. v0.5.0 stays mechanical (rename only). Identified concerns: context window pressure, complexity budget, backward compatibility, RAG platform dependency, personality drift over-engineering, social modeling privacy questions. Proposed phased adoption: v0.6.0 (wisdom + now.md), v0.7.0+ (social + episodic + RAG pending data), never (formal pre/post hooks).
