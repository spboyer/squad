# Orchestration Log Entry

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-08T04:12:29Z
**Agent:** Scribe
**Role:** Session Logger, Memory Manager & Decision Merger
**Mode:** background
**Requested by:** bradygaster

## Why Chosen

Brady asked for a prioritized todo table and bug status check. Coordinator found 12 unmerged inbox files — evidence of the P0 silent success bug cascade (Scribe not spawned after previous sessions). Scribe spawned to merge the backlog.

## Files Authorized to Read

- `.ai-team/decisions.md`
- `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/*` (12 files)
- `.ai-team/agents/scribe/history.md`
- `.ai-team/agents/*/history.md` (for cross-agent propagation)

## Files Produced

- `.ai-team/decisions.md` (12 inbox entries merged, 3 overlap groups consolidated)
- `.ai-team/log/2026-02-08-inbox-merge-and-status.md`
- `.ai-team/agents/*/history.md` (7 agents updated with team propagation notes)
- 12 inbox files deleted

## Outcome

✅ Success. All 12 orphaned inbox files merged. Inbox empty. Commit: edb351c. This is the FIRST orchestration log entry ever written — resolving the "orchestration log is dead" issue.
