# Orchestration Log: Verbal (Prompt Engineer)

**Agent:** Verbal  
**Date/Time:** 2026-02-20T21:33  
**Mode:** background  
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4.5 (bumped for prompt architecture)  

## Why Chosen

Prompt engineer analysis of memory proposal's identity and agent design implications. Verbal is responsible for spawn prompt architecture and agent voice consistency.

## Files Read

- Current spawn template structure
- Charter + history patterns
- Identity and hook model from proposal

## Files Produced

- `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/verbal-memory-architecture-review.md`

## Outcome

Endorsed wisdom/episode split (legitimate context bloat fix) and active state file (addresses agent cold-start). Rejected hook formalization (context budget already dense, hooks are just prompt text) and social modeling (mask.md is trust violation, contradicts charter consistency). Verdict: steal now/wisdom split + active state file inspired by now.md as state.md. Explicitly would NOT pursue: social modeling, hook formalization, YAML frontmatter, portable identity (squad-export.json handles it).
