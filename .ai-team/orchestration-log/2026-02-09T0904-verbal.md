**Agent:** Verbal (Prompt Engineer)

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Output
16 tone edits across 8 files:
- Removed AI-flowery language ("changes everything," "paradigm shift," "category-defining," etc.)
- Replaced with factual, confident language
- Left agent personalities intact (edginess, bluntness, polish)
- Charters, logs, orchestration logs already clean — no changes needed
