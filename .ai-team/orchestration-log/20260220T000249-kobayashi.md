# Kobayashi Spawn Log — 2026-02-20T00:02:49

**Agent:** Kobayashi (Git & Release Engineer)  
**Mode:** Background  
**Task:** Merge PRs #109–#113 into dev in dependency order

## Summary

Merged 5 v0.5.0 PRs into `dev` in correct dependency order. All PRs merged cleanly, 1 test failure caught and fixed with targeted commit. All 53 tests now pass. Session complete.

## Work Done

1. **PR #112** (templates move) — Merged ✅
2. **PR #111** (CLI dual-path) — Merged ✅
3. **PR #110** (email scrubbing) — Merged ✅
4. **PR #109** (workflow dual-path) — Merged ✅
5. **PR #113** (docs/tests) — Merged ✅ (with conflict resolution)
6. **Follow-up fix** — Fixed incomplete path update in `index.js` line 370

## Outcome

- **Branch:** dev
- **Tests:** 53/53 pass ✅
- **PRs closed:** 5
- **Time:** ~45 minutes

## Key Decisions

1. **Merge order:** PR #112 → #111 → #110 → #109 → #113 (dependency-driven)
2. **Conflict resolution (PR #109 vs #113):** Kept PR #109 versions (dual-path fallback more robust)
3. **Follow-up fix:** Single-line change to `index.js:370` to use `detectSquadDir()` instead of hardcoded `.ai-team/`
