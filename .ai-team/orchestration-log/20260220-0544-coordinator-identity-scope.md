## Coordinator — Identity Layer Scope Change to v0.5.0

**Spawn Time:** 2026-02-20 05:44 UTC  
**Agent:** Coordinator  
**Directive:** Brady

**What Happened:**
- Coordinator captured Brady's directive to fold wisdom.md + now.md into v0.5.0 (changed from v0.6.0)
- Created GitHub issue #107 to track the scope change
- Updated epic #69 with a comment reflecting the new scope

**Rationale:**
v0.5.0 is already touching every path in the `.squad/` directory rename, so adding the identity layer files (wisdom.md, now.md) requires near-zero marginal effort.

**Outcome:**
Identity layer files now in scope for v0.5.0 release. Issue and epic updated.
