# Session Log: 2026-02-20 v0.5.0 Fanout Batch 1

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Agents:** Fenster, Baer, Kobayashi  
**PRs Opened:** #111 (Fenster), #110 (Baer), #109 (Kobayashi)  
**Test Status:** 53/53 passing

## Overview
Three parallel agent spawns executed simultaneously to implement `.squad/` directory migration architecture:

1. **Fenster (Core Dev)** — CLI dual-path detection and upgrade command
2. **Baer (Security Specialist)** — Email privacy scrubbing utility and command
3. **Kobayashi (Git & Release Engineer)** — Workflow compatibility across directory structures

## Key Decisions
- New installs default to `.squad/`
- Existing repos remain on `.ai-team/` unless migrated
- Automatic email scrubbing integrated into migration flow
- All workflows support both directory paths (guard blocks)

## Outcomes
- 3 PRs opened and passing full test suite (53 tests)
- Infrastructure ready for gradual migration to `.squad/` naming
- Email privacy safeguards implemented at migration time
- CI/CD workflows support both old and new directory structures

## Next Steps
- Code review and merge of PRs #111, #110, #109
- Rollout communication for `.squad/` adoption
