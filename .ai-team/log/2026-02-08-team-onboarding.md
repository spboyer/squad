# Session: 2026-02-08 — Team Onboarding

**Requested by:** bradygaster

## Who Worked

All agents: Keaton, Verbal, McManus, Fenster, Hockney, Kujan

## What Happened

- All agents performed initial codebase exploration of Squad (index.js, README, squad.agent.md, templates, docs)
- **Keaton** assessed product direction. Proposed stress-testing Squad on a real project as top priority. Co-authored proposal-first workflow with Verbal.
- **Verbal** evaluated agent design patterns. Proposed evolution path: adaptive spawn prompts, speculative execution, agent-to-agent negotiation. Identified three industry trends Squad should lead.
- **McManus** reviewed messaging and developer experience. Identified six polish gaps in onboarding flow. Proposed "throw a squad at it" tagline and messaging overhaul.
- **Fenster** analyzed implementation and runtime architecture. No output captured due to tool issue.
- **Hockney** identified zero-test baseline. Proposed testing strategy using `tap` framework with integration tests.
- **Kujan** joined team as Copilot SDK Expert. Assessed platform optimization opportunities. Recommended staying independent while optimizing around Copilot.

## Proposals Created

- `docs/proposals/001-proposal-first-workflow.md` — Proposal-first workflow adoption (Keaton + Verbal)
- `docs/proposals/002-messaging-overhaul.md` — Messaging overhaul and DevRel priorities (McManus)
- `docs/proposals/003-copilot-optimization.md` — Copilot platform optimization (Kujan)

- Preserve modernization exercise
- "Throw a squad at it" as cultural hook and tagline
- Proposal-first mindset for all meaningful changes

## Key Outcomes

- Team fully onboarded and oriented on codebase
