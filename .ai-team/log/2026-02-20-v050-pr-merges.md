# 2026-02-20: v0.5.0 PR Merge Completion

**By:** Kobayashi  

All 5 v0.5.0 PRs merged into dev in dependency order. Merge sequence: #112 → #111 → #110 → #109 → #113. One conflict in 6 workflow files (both PRs #109 and #113 modified same files); resolution: kept PR #109 versions (dual-path fallback more robust). Post-merge test failure caught in marketplace state persistence; root cause: incomplete path update in `index.js:370`. Fixed with single-line change to use `detectSquadDir()`. Final result: 53/53 tests pass.

**Key artifact:** Detailed analysis in `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/kobayashi-v050-pr-merges.md`.
