**Status:** Complete

## Summary

Second wave of v0.5.0 path migration (#69 epic). Three agents executed in parallel on separate PRs focused on Squad governance (squad.agent.md), internal templates (.squad/templates/), and user documentation. All changes coordinated to merge together, ensuring path consistency across the entire project.

## PRs Opened

### PR #109-#113 (5 total)
All PRs target `dev` branch and are coordinated for simultaneous merge:

1. **PR #113** — Combined Verbal (#102) + McManus (#105): squad.agent.md path migration (93 refs) + documentation updates (7 files, 16 ref updates) + migration guide
2. **PR #112** — Fenster (#104): Template directory merge (.ai-team-templates/ → .squad/templates/)
3. **PR #111** — [CLI foundation, opened earlier]
4. **PR #110** — [Workflow dual-path support, opened earlier]
5. **PR #109** — [Initial path work, opened earlier]

**Merge Coordination:** PRs #113 and #112 should merge together in same commit window to avoid race conditions in squad.agent.md template references.

## Decisions Merged

Three inbox files merged into decisions.md:
1. Verbal's decision: squad.agent.md path migration to .squad/ (#102)
2. Fenster's decision: .ai-team-templates/ → .squad/templates/ merge (#104)
3. McManus's decision: Documentation path migration update pattern (#105)

All three decisions deduplicated (no overlaps — each covers distinct work packages).

## Cross-Agent Context Propagation

**Team Updates Appended to Agent Histories:**

- **Verbal's history.md**: Added entry on squad.agent.md governance changes (self-development note)
- **Fenster's history.md**: Added entry on template consolidation milestone
- **McManus's history.md**: Added entry on migration guide publication

---

## Coordination Notes

- **Dependencies resolved:** Fenster's dual-path infrastructure (#101) was prerequisite. All three agents coordinated on timing.
- **No blocking issues:** All 3 PRs independent — Fenster's template work doesn't conflict with Verbal's squad.agent.md changes (different code paths).
- **Test coverage:** 52/53 tests passing (1 pre-existing marketplace failure). Target is 53/53 before v0.5.0 release.
- **Backward compat preserved:** All three PRs maintain fallback language for legacy `.ai-team/` repos. Migration is optional in v0.5.0, required in v1.0.0.

## Next Steps

1. **Code review cycle** — 1-2 PRs per day through Feb 23
2. **Beta testing** — Insider branch tests against real repos
3. **Merge PR #113 + #112** together to `dev` (ensures path consistency)
4. **v0.5.0 release** — Scheduled for March 16 per Epic #91
