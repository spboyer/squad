# Session: 2026-02-09 — GitHub Distribution & Releases

**Requested by:** bradygaster

## Who Worked

- **bradygaster** — directed GitHub-only distribution, no npm publish ever
- **Kobayashi** — hired as Git & Release Engineer (7th team member); wrote Proposal 021 (release plan)
- **Fenster** — fixed index.js help text for GitHub distribution
- **Keaton** — amended sprint plan (019a): cancelled npm items, added release items

## Decisions Made

1. No npm publish — GitHub-only distribution via `npx github:bradygaster/squad`
2. Kobayashi hired as Git & Release Engineer, owns all git/GitHub responsibilities
3. Proposal 021 filed: release plan covering CI, tags, branch strategy, state integrity
4. Sprint plan 019a amended: item 1.8 cancelled, items 1.11–1.13 added (release workflow, branch strategy, first tagged release)

## Key Outcomes

- index.js help text updated to reflect GitHub distribution
- 019a effort totals adjusted (Wave 1: 18–22h, Total: 55.5–71.5h)
- Four decision files dropped to inbox for merge
