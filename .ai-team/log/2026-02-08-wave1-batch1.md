# Wave 1 Batch 1 — 2026-02-08

**Requested by:** Brady (bradygaster)

## Who Worked

- **Fenster** — error handling (1.1), version stamping (1.4)
- **Hockney** — CI setup (1.3)
- **Kujan** — directive capture (1.6)
- **Redfoot** — Concept E logo variations

## What Was Done

- Fenster: Centralized `fatal()` error handler, try/catch on all fs ops, pre-flight validation, uncaughtException safety net in index.js. Added `engines.node: ">=22.0.0"` to package.json for version stamping.
- Hockney: Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Node 22, runs on push/PR, no dependencies to install. Added CI badge to README.
- Kujan: Added directive capture section to `squad.agent.md` — coordinator writes user directives to decisions inbox before routing.
- Redfoot: Delivered 4 Concept E variations (E2–E5, 8 SVGs total).

## Key Outcomes

- All 12 tests pass.
- 4 of 7 sprint tasks complete (1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6).
- `squad.agent.md` updated with directive capture section.

## Decisions

- Error handling: `fatal()` pattern, fail-fast pre-flight checks, no stack traces in user output.
- Version stamping: `package.json` is sole version authority; `--version` reads from it.
- CI: Node 22 only, no matrix, no caching, badge at top of README.
- Directive capture: Coordinator persists user directives to decisions inbox before routing work.
