# Session: 2026-02-11 Client Parity Triage & Response

**Requested by:** Brady (bradygaster)

## What Happened

Keaton responded to Issue #9 (task tool naming confusion between CLI and VS Code). Response explained the difference:
- CLI has explicit `task` tool for sub-agent spawning
- VS Code uses subagent selection via `.agent.md` discovery
- VS Code parity is unverified; multi-agent orchestration may have gaps

Filed Issue #10 as P1 tracking issue: validate Squad's tool usage across all Copilot surfaces (CLI, VS Code, JetBrains, GitHub.com). Fallback strategies needed per client.

## Also This Session

- Fritz blog post credit updated: added @csharpfritz GitHub handle to community references
- Universe expansion completed: 6 new universes added (Monty Python, Doctor Who, Attack on Titan, Lord of the Rings, Succession, Severance). Policy expanded from 14 to 20 universes.
