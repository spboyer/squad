# Session: 2026-02-20 v0.4.2 Fanout

**Requested by:** Brady

## Work Summary

**McManus** picked up #93 (fix /agents vs /agent docs). Opened PR #100 targeting dev. Updated 6 documentation files for dual-platform command clarity.

**Kobayashi** picked up #94 (Insider Program infrastructure). Committed directly to dev as 263626a. Implemented CI/CD triggers, guard workflow, insider release workflow, documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, docs/insider-program.md, CONTRIBUTORS.md), and CLI help text. All 53 tests pass.

**Overlap:** Kobayashi bundled #93 fixes into commit 263626a, creating overlap with McManus's PR #100. Both address /agents vs /agent command documentation.

## Key Outcomes

- Insider branch infrastructure verified and ready for creation
- Dual-platform command clarity in progress (duplicate effort)
- All CI/CD pipelines configured and tested
