# Session: 2026-02-08 — Portable Squads Proposals

**Requested by:** bradygaster

## Who Worked

- **Keaton** — Wrote Proposal 008: Portable Squads architecture (history split, JSON manifest, CLI surface, no-merge-in-v1)
- **Verbal** — Wrote Proposal 008 experience design companion (preferences.md, squad-profile.md, memory split, five magic moments)
- **Kujan** — Wrote Proposal 008 platform feasibility analysis (CLI subcommands, .squad format, export payload, versioning plan)

## Key Decisions

- Brady added two critical constraints:
  1. **Forwardability** — all Squad updates must be upgradeable for existing users
  2. **Proposal-first** — no code changes until proposals are signed off
- Brady shared: Squad has 9 users; the whole division is talking about it

## Decisions Merged

- Keaton: Portable Squads architecture direction (Proposal 008)
- Kujan: Agent persistence and latency reduction — tiered response modes (Proposal 007)
- Kujan: Portable squads export/import design and platform feasibility (Proposal 008)
- Verbal: Portable Squads memory architecture and experience design (Proposal 008)
