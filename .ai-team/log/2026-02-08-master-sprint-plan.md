# Session Log: Master Sprint Plan

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Requested by:** bradygaster
**Agents involved:** Keaton (Lead)

## What Happened

Brady directed: "stack it all up — sprint plan it? all of it."

Keaton wrote Proposal 019: Master Sprint Plan — synthesizes all 18 prior proposals into one definitive execution plan.

## Key Outcomes

- **21 work items**, organized into 3 waves + parallel content track
- **Estimated effort:** 44–59 hours (~3 weeks with parallelism)
- **Supersedes:** Proposal 009 (v1 Sprint Plan) and Proposal 018 (Wave Execution Plan)

### Structure

- **Wave 1 (Quality):** Error handling, test expansion, CI, version stamping, silent success, human directive capture, "feels heard" behavior. Gate: 20+ tests, CI green, zero unhandled exceptions.
- **Wave 1.5 (Content, parallel):** README, messaging, Squad Paper, "where are we?" beat, demo script, video strategy.
- **Wave 2 (Experience):** Tiered response modes, smart upgrade, Skills Phase 1, Export CLI.
- **Wave 3 (Magical):** Import CLI, Skills Phase 2, history summarization, lightweight spawn.
- **Horizon (deferred):** Squad DM, agent-to-agent negotiation, speculative execution, sharing/registry, merge support.

## Brady's Four Directives Reflected

1. Quality-first ordering → Wave ordering
2. "Where are we?" as value prop → Items 1.5.4, 2.1, 1.5.1, 1.5.5, 1.5.6
3. Human directive capture → Item 1.6
4. "Feels heard" behavior → Item 1.7

## Decisions

- Proposal 019 is the single source of truth for v1 execution
- All agents execute from 019
- Wave gates are binary — no exceptions
