### 2026-02-11: Rename "sprints" to "milestones"
**By:** Brady (via Copilot), inspired by Jeff Fritz
**What:** Squad uses "milestones" instead of "sprints" for release planning units. Waves are feature-gated milestones, not time-boxed sprints. This aligns with GitHub's native Milestones feature and more accurately describes how Squad ships — when the work is done, not when a timer expires.
**Why:** Fritz suggested it during his video coverage. It's more accurate: Squad doesn't enforce time-boxed cadence. GitHub Milestones are a native platform concept we can integrate with. "Sprint" implies Scrum process overhead that doesn't exist here.
