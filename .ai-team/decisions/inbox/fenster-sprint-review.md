## Verdict: Approve with re-sequencing

The plan is good. The feature set is right. The dependency map is mostly correct. But the sequencing has a critical gap: **Proposal 015 (silent success bug) is not in the sprint plan at all**, and it should be Sprint 0 — before anything else ships.

Below is my section-by-section implementation review.

---

## 1. Sprint 1 Feasibility: Forwardability (~4 hours estimate)

**Assessment: 4 hours is about right for the `index.js` changes alone. But the plan undersells the scope.**

### What's actually involved

I already wrote Proposal 011 with the complete `index.js` sketch (~140 lines, up from 65). The plan's section 1.1 describes the intent correctly but glosses over implementation details I covered:

- **Version detection** needs three fallback strategies (`.squad-version` file → frontmatter parsing → presence detection). The plan just says "version header in squad.agent.md" — that's the easy part. Detecting pre-versioning installs (every current user) is the hard part.
- **Backup before overwrite** — the plan doesn't mention this. My Proposal 011 does. If upgrade clobbers a customized `squad.agent.md` with no backup, Brady will hear about it from users. Non-negotiable.
- **Migration framework** — even though v0.1→v0.2 has no data migrations, the framework needs to exist. Empty migrations array is fine, but the plumbing (getMigrations, ordered execution, idempotency) must be built now or we'll be retrofitting it under pressure when v0.3 needs it.
- **Error handling** — backup failure aborts. Overwrite failure restores backup. Migration failure warns but continues. This is not trivial code.

### What's missing from the plan

1. **The plan says init should "always write squad.agent.md" (remove skip-if-exists)**. My Proposal 011 disagrees. Init should still skip if exists, but HINT at upgrade. Reason: `npx create-squad` is what users run in CI, in scripts, in onboarding docs. Silently overwriting their coordinator without warning on every `npx create-squad` is wrong. The plan's proposed change means any re-run of the init command overwrites — that's not forwardability, that's clobbering.

2. **No mention of `.squad-version` metadata file.** Where does the installed version live? The plan says "version header in squad.agent.md" but that couples version detection to parsing a 32KB markdown file. My proposal uses a dedicated `.ai-team-templates/.squad-version` JSON file.

3. **Templates overwrite behavior.** The plan says upgrade overwrites templates. Fine. But init should still skip templates if they exist (same as coordinator). The plan marks both init and upgrade as "always overwrite" — that changes init semantics in a way users don't expect.

### Revised estimate

- `index.js` rewrite with upgrade, version detection, backup, migrations: **4-5 hours**
- `squad.agent.md` version header addition: **15 minutes**
- Testing the upgrade path on a real v0.1.0 install: **1 hour**
- **Total: ~6 hours** (not 4)

### Recommendation

Use Proposal 011's `index.js` sketch as the implementation baseline, not the plan's simplified pseudocode. The sketch handles all the edge cases the plan skips.

## 2. Sprint 2 Feasibility: Export/Import CLI (~6 hours estimate)

**Assessment: 6 hours is unrealistic. 10-12 hours minimum.**

### What's actually hard

The plan lists the export manifest schema and import flow as if they're straightforward file operations. They're not.

#### Export edge cases the plan misses:

1. **History heuristic extraction.** The plan says "Portable Knowledge section only" for history export, with "heuristic extraction for unsplit histories." There IS no heuristic yet. Writing one that correctly separates "Brady prefers explicit error handling" from "Auth module is in src/auth/" from a flat history.md is an LLM task, not a regex task. And we said we're not using LLM-assisted classification in v1 — so what's the actual heuristic? This is undefined work.

2. **Casting state validation.** The plan exports `registry.json`, `history.json`, `policy.json` as opaque blobs. What if they reference files or paths specific to the source project? What if universe assignments are inconsistent? Export needs to validate, not just copy.

3. **Manifest size.** Skills + charters + portable knowledge + casting state + routing. If a squad has worked on 5 domains with 6 agents, this manifest could be large. The plan doesn't set size limits or mention chunking.

4. **Encoding.** History files may contain unicode, emoji, special characters. JSON.stringify handles this but we need to verify round-trip fidelity with real history.md content.

#### Import edge cases the plan misses:

1. **Manifest validation.** "Validate `.squad` or `.json` manifest" — what's the validation? Schema checking? Version compatibility? The plan doesn't define what makes a manifest invalid. A malformed manifest shouldn't silently create a broken squad.

2. **Conflict with existing `.ai-team/`.** The plan says "refuse if `.ai-team/team.md` exists (unless `--force`)". But what about partial state? What if `.ai-team/` exists but `team.md` doesn't? What if agents/ exists with some but not all of the imported agents? The detection needs to be more nuanced than "team.md exists."

3. **`--force` archive naming.** `.ai-team-archive-{timestamp}/` — what timestamp format? ISO 8601 with colons doesn't work as a directory name on Windows. Need `YYYYMMDD-HHmmss` or similar.

4. **Import of skills.md.** The plan says "Write skills.md from manifest." But what if skills.md already has content from the current project and we're not using `--force`? This is a merge problem the plan explicitly defers to v2, but import without merge means destroying local skills.

#### The dependency problem:

Export depends on history split (2.1) AND skills (2.2). Both are prompt-engineering changes to `squad.agent.md`. Until agents are actually writing to the new history format and skills.md, there's nothing meaningful to export. The plan acknowledges this dependency but underestimates the testing overhead: you need a squad that has actually USED the new formats to verify export captures them correctly.

### Revised estimate

- Export command implementation: **3-4 hours**
- Import command implementation: **3-4 hours**
- Manifest validation: **2 hours**
- History heuristic (or deciding to punt it): **1-2 hours**
- Round-trip testing: **2 hours**
- **Total: 11-14 hours** (not 6)

### Recommendation

Ship export-only in Sprint 2. Import is Sprint 3. Export is useful immediately (backup/audit). Import without thorough testing is dangerous — it creates broken squads.

## 3. P0 Priority Check: Silent Success Bug (Proposal 015)

**Assessment: This MUST be Sprint 0. Before everything else.**

### Why it blocks the sprint plan

The silent success bug means ~40% of agent spawns lose their response text. The sprint plan's entire development process uses Squad to build Squad. If Verbal writes the tiered response mode changes to `squad.agent.md` and the coordinator reports "did not produce a response," we've lost work. If I implement forwardability and my response vanishes, Brady sees failure where there was success.

**You cannot build v1 with a tool that lies about success 40% of the time.**

### Proposal 015's mitigations are zero-risk

Every change in Proposal 015 is a prompt instruction change to `squad.agent.md`:

1. Response order guidance (tell agents to end with text, not tool calls) — ~15 minutes to edit
2. Silent success detection (coordinator checks for files when response is empty) — ~30 minutes to edit
3. `read_agent` timeout increase (`wait: true`, `timeout: 300`) — ~10 minutes to edit

**Total implementation: ~1 hour.** These are instruction edits, not code changes.

### The trust argument

Brady said "human trust is P0." If Squad reports "agent did not produce a response" when the agent actually wrote a 45KB proposal, that's a trust-destroying moment. The user thinks the system failed. The system actually succeeded. This is worse than an actual failure — at least real failures are honest.

### Recommendation

Ship Proposal 015 as Sprint 0. One hour of work. Zero risk. Immediately makes the rest of the sprint more reliable. Don't start Sprint 1 without this.

---

## 4. My Re-sequencing

Given "human trust is P0," here's the order I'd build in:

### Sprint 0: Trust Foundation (Day 0, ~2 hours)

1. **Silent success bug fix** (Proposal 015) — prompt changes to `squad.agent.md`
2. **Response format enforcement** — same file, same edit session

This unblocks everything. Every subsequent sprint benefits from agents that reliably report their work.

### Sprint 1: Forwardability + Latency (Days 1-3)

1. **`index.js` rewrite** with upgrade, version detection, backup, migrations (Proposal 011 sketch)
2. **Latency fixes** — context caching, Scribe batching (prompt changes)
3. **Tiered response modes** — routing table in `squad.agent.md` (prompt changes)
4. **Coordinator direct handling** — permission expansion (prompt changes)

Items 2-4 are all prompt edits. They can ship independently of item 1. Item 1 is the code work.

### Sprint 2: Portability Foundation (Days 4-7)

1. **History split** — template + prompt changes (prerequisite for everything else)
2. **Skills system** — template + prompt changes
3. **Export CLI** — `create-squad export` command in `index.js`
4. **Defer import to Sprint 3** — export is useful alone; import needs more testing

### Sprint 3: Import + Polish + Tests (Days 8-10+)

1. **Import CLI** — `create-squad import` with proper validation
2. **Imported squad detection** — coordinator prompt change
3. **Testing infrastructure** — Hockney's 5 core tests
4. **README rewrite** — McManus
5. **History summarization** — if time permits

### Why this order

- Sprint 0 makes every subsequent sprint more reliable
- Export before import: export is a backup mechanism even without import
- Import gets more testing time, which it desperately needs
- Tests can cover export AND import in Sprint 3 instead of testing export in Sprint 2 and import in Sprint 3 separately

## 5. Dependencies the Plan Gets Wrong

### Marked parallel but has a hard dependency:

1. **2.3 Export/Import depends on 2.2 Skills.** The plan shows this correctly in the dependency diagram but then assigns both to Sprint 2 days 4-7 as if they can overlap. Skills system (prompt engineering) must be DONE before export knows what to export. If skills.md format changes during export development, export breaks. **Verdict: Skills must be finalized before export begins. At least 1 day gap.**

2. **3.2 Testing depends on export AND import.** The plan's test list includes "Export/import round-trip" and "Skills persistence test." If import is in Sprint 2, testing it in Sprint 3 works. But if import bugs are found in testing, the fix cycle bleeds past Sprint 3. **Verdict: Import and tests should overlap in Sprint 3 with buffer for fix cycles.**

### Marked sequential but could be parallel:

1. **2.1 History split and 1.1 Forwardability.** The plan says "Sprint 2 blocks: Sprint 1 must ship first (forwardability is prerequisite for template updates reaching users)." This is wrong for development purposes. History split is a prompt change to `squad.agent.md` — it doesn't require forwardability to DEVELOP. It requires forwardability to SHIP to existing users. Development can start in parallel. Only the final `squad.agent.md` delivery needs Sprint 1 done. **Verdict: History split development starts Day 1. Just don't merge into the coordinator file until upgrade works.**

2. **3.1 README rewrite and Sprint 2.** The plan notes McManus "can start README draft" during Sprint 2. McManus can start the README Day 1. The README doesn't depend on any implementation — it's messaging work. Only the final version needs feature screenshots/demos. **Verdict: README drafting is fully parallel from Day 1.**

3. **3.4 Lightweight spawn template and 1.3 Tiered modes.** The plan marks this as dependent. It's not — the lightweight template is a standalone prompt blob. It references tiered mode concepts but doesn't require the routing table to exist. Both are edits to the same file. **Verdict: Can be developed in parallel, merged together.**

### Missing dependency:

1. **Export/Import depends on `package.json` updates.** The manifest includes `exported_from` and version info. The package.json version must be bumped to 0.2.0 before export generates correct manifests. The plan mentions version bump in passing but doesn't sequence it. **Verdict: Version bump is Sprint 1, item 1.**

---

## Summary for Brady

The sprint plan is solid architecture, weak on implementation details. My recommendations:

1. **Add Sprint 0** — ship Proposal 015 (silent success bug) immediately. 1 hour, zero risk, unblocks trust.
2. **Revise Sprint 1 estimate** from 4 to 6 hours for forwardability. Use Proposal 011's implementation, not the plan's simplified version.
3. **Revise Sprint 2 estimate** from 6 to 11-14 hours for export/import. Or split: export in Sprint 2, import in Sprint 3.
4. **Start parallel tracks earlier** — README and history split development can begin Day 1.
5. **Keep the "What We're NOT Doing" list** — it's the most important section of the plan. Don't let scope creep.

The plan's total timeline of 10 days is achievable IF we split import from export. If we try to do both in Sprint 2 with the current 6-hour estimate, Sprint 2 will overrun and compress Sprint 3.

With re-sequencing: **12 days total, high confidence.** Without: **10 days, medium confidence with Sprint 2 overrun risk.**
