# Project Context

- **Owner:** bradygaster (bradygaster@users.noreply.github.com)
- **Project:** Squad — AI agent teams that grow with your code. Democratizing multi-agent development on GitHub Copilot. Mission: beat the industry to what customers need next.
- **Stack:** Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, multi-agent orchestration
- **Created:** 2026-02-07

## Core Context

_Summarized from initial architecture review (2026-02-07). Full entries in `history-archive.md`._

- **Squad is a markdown-as-runtime system** — the entire orchestration is a 32KB `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` file interpreted by the LLM. `index.js` is a minimal installer (~65 lines initially) that copies the coordinator manifest and templates.
- **File system is the IPC layer** — agents write decisions to `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/`, Scribe merges to canonical `decisions.md`. This drop-box pattern eliminates write conflicts during parallel spawns.
- **File ownership model is foundational** — Squad-owned files (squad.agent.md, templates) are safe to overwrite on upgrade. User-owned files (.ai-team/) are never touched. This classification drives the entire forwardability strategy.
- **Upgrade architecture uses version-keyed idempotent migrations** — version detection via frontmatter parsing, backup before overwrite, `process.argv[2]` subcommand routing with no external dependencies.
- **Windows path safety is non-negotiable** — all file operations use `path.join()`, no hardcoded separators, no symlinks, pure `fs` operations only.
- **Key file paths**: `squad.agent.md` (coordinator), `index.js` (installer), `.ai-team/casting/` (registry/history/policy JSONs), `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/` (drop-box), `templates/` (format guides).

## Recent Updates

📌 Team update (2026-02-13): VS Code runSubagent spawning — platform parity and adaptation strategy (consolidated). runSubagent viable with platform detection and custom .agent.md files.

## Learnings

- **Provider abstraction belongs at the prompt level, not in index.js.** The coordinator is a prompt that executes shell commands. A JavaScript provider module would require index.js to be a runtime (it's an installer) and would double the maintenance surface. Command templates in squad.agent.md are the correct abstraction layer.
- **index.js has near-zero GitHub-platform coupling.** The `.github/agents/` path is a Copilot CLI convention, not GitHub-the-platform. The only GitHub-specific code is the `npx github:bradygaster/squad` usage string (cosmetic). All real platform coupling is in squad.agent.md.
- **Capability negotiation is critical for multi-provider support.** ADO has no labels (uses Tags), no reactions, and requires work item types. GitLab has no sub-issues. The provider interface must declare what's available so the coordinator can adapt.
- **Two-channel pattern (MCP read, gh CLI write) is GitHub-specific, not universal.** Future providers will likely be CLI-only. The MCP fallback logic should be inside the GitHub provider, not in the generic interface.
- **Git remote URL parsing covers 95% of provider detection.** `github.com` → GitHub, `dev.azure.com`/`visualstudio.com` → ADO, `gitlab.com` → GitLab. Self-hosted instances need CLI-based detection (is `glab` configured?). Generic is the fallback.
- **ADO is the hardest provider.** WIQL for search, Tags for labels, Iterations for milestones, Work Item Types for issues — every concept has an impedance mismatch. GitLab is the easiest (glab mirrors gh closely). Estimate: ADO 23h, GitLab 12h, GitHub reorganization 9h.


📌 Team update (2026-02-10): v0.3.0 is ONE feature — proposals as GitHub Issues. All other items deferred. — decided by bradygaster

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Actions automation ships as opt-in templates in templates/workflows/, 3 workflows in v0.3.0. — decided by Keaton, Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Label taxonomy (39 labels, 7 namespaces) drives entire GitHub-native workflow. — decided by bradygaster, Verbal

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): CCA governance must be self-contained in squad.agent.md (cannot read .ai-team/). — decided by Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Proposal migration uses three-wave approach — active first, shipped second, superseded/deferred last. — decided by Keaton


📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Project boards consolidated — v0.4.0 target confirmed, gh CLI (not npm), opt-in only, labels authoritative over boards. Community triage responses must use substantive technical detail. — decided by Keaton, Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Per-agent model selection implemented with cost-first directive (optimize cost unless writing code) — decided by Brady and Verbal

📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Discord is the v0.3.0 MVP messaging connector. Gateway must be platform-agnostic with zero GitHub-specific imports. — decided by Keaton

- **UTF-8 emoji mojibake in test file.** `test/index.test.js` had 8 instances of garbled emoji strings (e.g. `≡ƒæñ` instead of `👤`, `≡ƒôî` instead of `📌`, `≡ƒñû` instead of `🤖`, `≡ƒƒó`/`≡ƒƒí`/`≡ƒö┤` instead of `🟢`/`🟡`/`🔴`). Root cause: file was likely saved or transferred through a system that re-encoded UTF-8 multibyte sequences as Latin-1/CP1252. Fixed all 8 instances to use real Unicode codepoints matching what `index.js` and `squad.agent.md` produce. All 118 tests pass.

- **Universe allowlist expansion (issue #21).** Added Adventure Time (community request from Gabe) plus 10 new universes to the allowlist in both `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` and `.ai-team/casting/policy.json`. New universes: Futurama, Seinfeld, The Office, Cowboy Bebop, Fullmetal Alchemist, Stranger Things, The Expanse, Arcane, Ted Lasso, Dune. Selection rationale: filled genre gaps (sitcom, anime, animation, workplace comedy, hard sci-fi, sports/comedy). Total universes went from 20 → 31. Constraints added for The Office (avoid Michael Scott at scale) and Dune (combine book/film, avoid Paul unless required). Closed issue #21.


📌 Team update (2026-02-12): Universe expansion complete — 11 new universes (Adventure Time, Futurama, Seinfeld, The Office, Cowboy Bebop, Fullmetal Alchemist, Stranger Things, The Expanse, Arcane, Ted Lasso, Dune) added to casting allowlist. Issue #21 closed. — decided by Fenster

- **SSH agent / npm spinner hang documented (issue #30).** `npx github:bradygaster/squad` resolves via `git+ssh://`. When no SSH agent is running, git prompts for a passphrase but npm's progress spinner overwrites the TTY prompt, making it look frozen. This is an npm bug, not ours. Documented workarounds in README (Install section note + Known Limitations bullet) and created `docs/scenarios/troubleshooting.md` with problem→cause→fix format covering SSH hang, gh auth, Node version, agent visibility, upgrade cache, and Windows paths. The troubleshooting doc pattern is reusable for future community-reported issues.

- **Label automation for go: and release: namespaces.** Created `squad-label-enforce.yml` workflow to enforce mutual exclusivity on `go:*` (triage verdict) and `release:*` (version target) labels. When a new label is applied, conflicting labels in the same namespace are auto-removed and a comment is posted (only if a change was made). Special cases: applying `go:yes` auto-adds `release:backlog` if no release target exists; applying `go:no` removes all release labels. Updated `sync-squad-labels.yml` to sync 3 go: labels (go:yes, go:no, go:needs-research) and 5 release: labels (release:v0.4.0, v0.5.0, v0.6.0, v1.0.0, release:backlog). Updated `squad-triage.yml` to apply `go:needs-research` as default verdict after triage assigns a squad member. Updated `squad-heartbeat.yml` to add two new checks: issues missing go: labels and go:yes issues missing release: labels. This implements "agentic DevOps" — labels drive automation, automation enforces label integrity.
📌 Team update (2026-02-13): Agent Progress Updates — Milestone Signals + Coordinator Polling mechanism. 30s polling loop extracts [MILESTONE] markers from agent output. No agent code changes. Backward compatible. Unlocks notifications + Squad DM integration. — decided by Keaton
📌 Team update (2026-02-14): VS Code Model & Background Parity — Phase 1 (v0.4.0): accept session model, use runSubagent. Phase 2 (v0.5.0): generate model-tier agent files. runSubagent lacks model param; use prompt-level detection in squad.agent.md. — decided by Kujan
📌 Team update (2026-02-15): VS Code File Discovery — Works with zero code changes. Instruction-level abstraction naturally cross-platform. Constraints: single-root workspaces only, workspace trust required, tool approval UX on first write. — decided by Strausz

- **GitHub Projects V2 — Phase 1 validation complete (WI-1 + WI-2, Issue #6).** All `gh project *` CLI commands validated live against bradygaster/squad. Created test board, discovered field IDs, added issue #6, moved between all status columns (Todo→In Progress→Done), archived, linked to repo, deleted. Key findings: (1) Zero dependencies confirmed — no GraphQL client needed, `gh project` wraps everything. (2) `project` scope already present on token. (3) 4-step field discovery pipeline works — field IDs are project-specific but stable. (4) `item-add` is idempotent. (5) `item-edit` requires 4 opaque IDs (project, item, field, option) — most complex command. (6) Windows works via PowerShell `ConvertFrom-Json` instead of `jq`. Created SKILL.md at `.ai-team/skills/github-projects-v2-commands/SKILL.md` and implementation proposal at `team-docs/proposals/006a-project-board-implementation.md`. Provider abstraction documented: GitHub (implemented), ADO/GitLab (stubbed). Phase 1 gate passed — Phase 2 unblocked. Posted findings to issue #6.

📌 Team update (2026-02-15): Projects V2 Phase 1 validated — `gh project *` CLI commands work for all board operations. SKILL.md + implementation proposal shipped. Phase 2 (coordinator prompts + label sync workflow) unblocked. — decided by Fenster


📌 Team update (2026-02-13): Projects V2 Phase 1 validation complete — all gh project * commands validated live, no npm dependencies needed. Unblocks WI-3 (board init), WI-4 (label-to-board sync), WI-5 (board query). — decided by Fenster

- **MCP integration shipped (#11).** Added MCP Integration section to squad.agent.md (after Client Compatibility, before Eager Execution): detection via tool prefix scanning, routing rules (coordinator direct vs spawn with context), graceful degradation (CLI fallback → inform user → continue without), config file locations, Trello sample config. References the existing MCP skill at `.ai-team/skills/mcp-tool-discovery/SKILL.md` instead of duplicating it. Updated spawn template with optional MCP TOOLS AVAILABLE block. Added MCP config generation to `squad init` (creates `.copilot/mcp-config.json` sample with `EXAMPLE-trello` prefix pattern). Added 0.4.0 upgrade migration so existing installs get the sample config on `squad upgrade`. Both init and migration are idempotent (skip if file exists).

- **Docs template extraction — inline→external files.** Refactored `docs/build.js` to read HTML template, CSS, and JS from external files instead of generating them inline via `getCSS()`, `getJS()`, and `getTemplate()` string-building functions. Created `docs/assets/template.html` (HTML shell with `{{title}}`, `{{nav}}`, `{{content}}`, `{{searchIndex}}`, `{{basePath}}` placeholders), `docs/assets/style.css`, and `docs/assets/script.js`. Build reads template once at startup, does placeholder replacement per page. CSS/JS are linked externally (`<link>` / `<script src>`), search index remains inlined as page-specific `<script>` block. The existing `copyDir` of `docs/assets/` → `_site/assets/` handles deploying CSS/JS automatically. Key paths: `docs/assets/template.html`, `docs/assets/style.css`, `docs/assets/script.js`.

- **Copilot CLI agent manifest YAML frontmatter validation (issue #59).** The `version` field in squad.agent.md's YAML frontmatter was not a supported property per the [GitHub Copilot CLI agent manifest specification](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-agents-configuration). Supported properties are: `name`, `description`, `tools`, and `mcp-servers` (org/enterprise only). Unsupported properties like `version`, `model`, `argument-hint`, and `handoffs` cause the Copilot CLI parser to throw "error: too many arguments" because it interprets them as command-line arguments. Fixed by moving version tracking from YAML frontmatter to an HTML comment (`<!-- version: X.Y.Z -->`) immediately after the frontmatter closing `---`. Updated `stampVersion()` and `readInstalledVersion()` in index.js to work with the new HTML comment format (with backward compatibility fallback for upgrade scenarios). The agent name was also simplified from `Squad (v0.0.0-source)` to just `Squad` in the frontmatter. This pattern applies to all custom agent manifests — only use officially supported YAML properties to avoid parser errors.
