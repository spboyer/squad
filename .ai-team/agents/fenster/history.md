# Project Context

- **Owner:** bradygaster (bradygaster@users.noreply.github.com)
- **Project:** Squad — AI agent teams that grow with your code. Democratizing multi-agent development on GitHub Copilot. Mission: beat the industry to what customers need next.
- **Stack:** Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, multi-agent orchestration
- **Created:** 2026-02-07

## Core Context

_Summarized from initial architecture review (2026-02-07). Full entries in `history-archive.md`._

- **Squad is a markdown-as-runtime system** — the entire orchestration is a 32KB `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` file interpreted by the LLM. `index.js` is a minimal installer (~65 lines initially) that copies the coordinator manifest and templates.
- **File system is the IPC layer** — agents write decisions to `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/`, Scribe merges to canonical `decisions.md`. This drop-box pattern eliminates write conflicts during parallel spawns.
- **File ownership model is foundational** — Squad-owned files (squad.agent.md, templates) are safe to overwrite on upgrade. User-owned files (.ai-team/) are never touched. This classification drives the entire forwardability strategy.
- **Upgrade architecture uses version-keyed idempotent migrations** — version detection via frontmatter parsing, backup before overwrite, `process.argv[2]` subcommand routing with no external dependencies.
- **Windows path safety is non-negotiable** — all file operations use `path.join()`, no hardcoded separators, no symlinks, pure `fs` operations only.
- **Key file paths**: `squad.agent.md` (coordinator), `index.js` (installer), `.ai-team/casting/` (registry/history/policy JSONs), `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/` (drop-box), `templates/` (format guides).

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Async comms strategy decided — two-tier MVP: CCA-as-squad-member (2-4h, prompt-only) + Telegram bridge (8-16h, conditional on SDK spike). CCA is the floor. — decided by Kujan

## Learnings

- **Provider abstraction belongs at the prompt level, not in index.js.** The coordinator is a prompt that executes shell commands. A JavaScript provider module would require index.js to be a runtime (it's an installer) and would double the maintenance surface. Command templates in squad.agent.md are the correct abstraction layer.
- **index.js has near-zero GitHub-platform coupling.** The `.github/agents/` path is a Copilot CLI convention, not GitHub-the-platform. The only GitHub-specific code is the `npx github:bradygaster/squad` usage string (cosmetic). All real platform coupling is in squad.agent.md.
- **Capability negotiation is critical for multi-provider support.** ADO has no labels (uses Tags), no reactions, and requires work item types. GitLab has no sub-issues. The provider interface must declare what's available so the coordinator can adapt.
- **Two-channel pattern (MCP read, gh CLI write) is GitHub-specific, not universal.** Future providers will likely be CLI-only. The MCP fallback logic should be inside the GitHub provider, not in the generic interface.
- **Git remote URL parsing covers 95% of provider detection.** `github.com` → GitHub, `dev.azure.com`/`visualstudio.com` → ADO, `gitlab.com` → GitLab. Self-hosted instances need CLI-based detection (is `glab` configured?). Generic is the fallback.
- **ADO is the hardest provider.** WIQL for search, Tags for labels, Iterations for milestones, Work Item Types for issues — every concept has an impedance mismatch. GitLab is the easiest (glab mirrors gh closely). Estimate: ADO 23h, GitLab 12h, GitHub reorganization 9h.

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Actions automation ships as opt-in templates in templates/workflows/, 3 workflows in v0.3.0. — decided by Keaton, Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Label taxonomy (39 labels, 7 namespaces) drives entire GitHub-native workflow. — decided by bradygaster, Verbal

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): CCA governance must be self-contained in squad.agent.md (cannot read .ai-team/). — decided by Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Proposal migration uses three-wave approach — active first, shipped second, superseded/deferred last. — decided by Keaton


📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Project boards consolidated — v0.4.0 target confirmed, gh CLI (not npm), opt-in only, labels authoritative over boards. Community triage responses must use substantive technical detail. — decided by Keaton, Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Per-agent model selection implemented with cost-first directive (optimize cost unless writing code) — decided by Brady and Verbal

📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Discord is the v0.3.0 MVP messaging connector. Gateway must be platform-agnostic with zero GitHub-specific imports. — decided by Keaton

- **UTF-8 emoji mojibake in test file.** `test/index.test.js` had 8 instances of garbled emoji strings (e.g. `≡ƒæñ` instead of `👤`, `≡ƒôî` instead of `📌`, `≡ƒñû` instead of `🤖`, `≡ƒƒó`/`≡ƒƒí`/`≡ƒö┤` instead of `🟢`/`🟡`/`🔴`). Root cause: file was likely saved or transferred through a system that re-encoded UTF-8 multibyte sequences as Latin-1/CP1252. Fixed all 8 instances to use real Unicode codepoints matching what `index.js` and `squad.agent.md` produce. All 118 tests pass.
