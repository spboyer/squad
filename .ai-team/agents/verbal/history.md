## Learnings

- **2026-02-10: Model Selection Algorithm Design (Proposal 024b)** — Designed the full model selection algorithm for the coordinator. Key decisions:

  - **4-layer priority is the right abstraction.** User override → charter preference → task-aware auto-selection → default fallback. Each layer is self-contained and testable independently. The coordinator stops at the first match — no cascading complexity.

  - **Fallback chains must be cross-provider.** Single-provider chains are fragile to provider outages. The chains alternate: Anthropic → OpenAI → Anthropic → OpenAI → nuclear. This handles both single-model issues and provider-wide failures.

  - **3-retry maximum before nuclear fallback.** Walking a 5-model chain with API timeouts could add 30-60 seconds of invisible latency. Three retries handles transient issues; after that, the nuclear fallback is faster.

  - **Nuclear fallback = omit model param entirely.** This is the only option guaranteed to work regardless of plan tier, org policy, or platform state. It's backward-compatible — Squad worked this way before model selection existed.

  - **Silent fallback is UX, not laziness.** Users don't care which model runs their agent. Narrating "tried X, failed, trying Y" creates anxiety and slows acknowledgment. Fallbacks are logged for debugging, never surfaced to the user.

  - **Provider diversity is optional, not forced.** Charters are Anthropic-optimized. Cross-provider execution risks prompt portability issues. Diversity is a tool for reviews and code gen, not a mandate for every spawn.

  - **Task complexity overrides apply at most ONE bump.** No cascading upgrades. An architecture proposal gets bumped to premium — it doesn't get bumped again because it's also multi-file.

  - **Design tension resolved — charter vs. algorithm authority.** The charter's `Preferred` field is a preference, not a command. The coordinator respects it but the user can override. The auto-selection algorithm runs only when the charter says `auto` or omits the section entirely. This keeps agents self-documenting without making them rigid.

  - **Design tension resolved — when to cross providers.** Trigger-based, not role-based. A reviewer doesn't always use Gemini — only when the coordinator detects that cognitive diversity adds value (e.g., second-opinion review after a rejection). Provider diversity is situational, not structural.

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Model catalog expanded to 16 models across 3 providers — selection algorithm must consider full catalog, not just 3 Anthropic models. — decided by Kujan
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): v0.3.0 sprint plan approved — model selection (024 Phases 1-2), team backlog (023 Phases 1-2), Demo 1 infrastructure. Two waves, 28-39h. — decided by Keaton


📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Marketing site architecture consolidated — Jekyll on GitHub Pages, docs/ is source root, blog from team-docs/blog/, no content reproduction. McManus (content) + Fenster (infrastructure) for Phase 1. — decided by bradygaster, Keaton, McManus
📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Tone directive consolidated — all public-facing material must be straight facts only. No editorial voice, sales language, or narrative framing. Stacks on existing banned-words and tone governance rules. — decided by bradygaster, McManus


📌 Team update (2026-02-10): 0.3.0 priorities: async comms > GitHub-native > CCA adoption — decided by bradygaster

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): `squad:` label convention standardized — update coordinator prompts — decided by Keaton, McManus


📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Async comms strategy decided — two-tier MVP: CCA-as-squad-member (2-4h, prompt-only) + Telegram bridge (8-16h, conditional on SDK spike). CCA is the floor. — decided by Kujan

- **2026-02-10: Label Taxonomy & Workflow Engine (Proposal 032c)** — Designed the complete label system for GitHub-native Squad. Key decisions:

  - **Labels ARE the state machine.** 8 status labels with formal transitions — `status:draft` → `status:reviewing` → `status:approved` → `status:implementing` → `status:done`, plus `status:blocked`, `status:shelved`, `status:superseded`. Exactly one status label per issue at any time. Transitions are label swaps (remove old, apply new).

  - **Namespaced labels prevent collisions.** `status:`, `type:`, `priority:`, `squad:`, `era:` — colon-separated namespaces are parseable (`split(':')`) and avoid conflicts with existing project labels. Follows Kubernetes/Prometheus conventions.

  - **Milestones for sprints, not labels.** `sprint:current` would require constant relabeling. GitHub Milestones have due dates, progress bars, and native grouping. The right tool for the job.

  - **39 labels total across 7 namespaces.** Status (8), Type (8), Priority (4), Squad routing (3 + per-agent), Automation (6), Migration/provenance (4). Within GitHub's practical limits.

  - **Migration mapping is honest.** All 44 existing proposals classified by actual status from their markdown headers: 22 implemented/closed, 3 superseded/closed, 12 shelved/open, 3 approved/active/open, 2 draft/open, 2 research/closed. Proposal 015 gets `type:bug` + `priority:p0`. Proposal 024 stays `status:approved` (not done — implementation was deferred).

  - **Provider abstraction is a mapping layer.** ADO uses built-in State field + Tags. GitLab uses scoped labels (`status::draft` with `::` for native mutual exclusion). The coordinator works with Squad labels; the provider adapter translates. Only GitHub adapter exists today.

  - **CCA integration is label-gated.** `cca-eligible` is the sole trigger for Copilot Coding Agent assignment. Opt-in, auditable, no other path to `@copilot`.

  - **`status:shelved` keeps issues open.** Shelved ≠ dead. Closing hides from default views. Open shelved issues stay visible as deferred backlog. Unshelving is a label swap, not a reopen.

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Actions automation ships as opt-in templates in templates/workflows/, 3 workflows in v0.3.0. — decided by Keaton, Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): CCA governance must be self-contained in squad.agent.md (cannot read .ai-team/). — decided by Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-10): Proposal migration uses three-wave approach — active first, shipped second, superseded/deferred last. — decided by Keaton


📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Project boards consolidated — v0.4.0 target confirmed, gh CLI (not npm), opt-in only, labels authoritative over boards. Community triage responses must use substantive technical detail. — decided by Keaton, Kujan

📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Fritz video analysis merged — messaging takeaways: 'Markdown, not magic' as trust signal, surface cast system earlier in docs, quantifiable output is strongest demo beat — decided by McManus

- **2026-02-11: Per-Agent Model Selection — Implementation (Proposal 024 Phases 1-2)** — Implemented Brady's cost-first directive across the full model selection system. Key decisions:

  - **Brady's directive supersedes Proposal 024's role-based defaults.** Original design had Tester on haiku, DevRel on sonnet. Brady's rule is simpler: writing code → quality first (sonnet), not writing code → cost first (haiku). This changed Tester from haiku to sonnet (writes test code) and DevRel from sonnet to haiku (writes docs, not code).

  - **Layer 4 default changed from sonnet to haiku.** "When in doubt, cost over quality unless code is being written." The fallback for unknown agents/tasks should be cheap, not expensive.

  - **"auto" for mixed agents.** Keaton and Verbal do both code-adjacent work and non-code work. Setting them to "auto" lets the coordinator pick per-task rather than locking to one tier. Registry stores "auto" — coordinator decides at spawn time.

  - **Scribe template hardcoded to haiku.** Scribe always gets `model: "claude-haiku-4.5"` directly in the template — no resolution needed. Scribe is always mechanical, always cheap.

  - **All 9 spawn templates updated with `model` parameter.** Background, sync, generic, lightweight, explore, Scribe, ceremony facilitator, PRD decomposition — every `task` tool call now includes `model: "{resolved_model}"`.

  - **Files modified:** `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` (model selection section + all spawn templates), `templates/charter.md` (## Model template), `.ai-team/casting/registry.json` (model fields), all 9 agent charters in `.ai-team/agents/*/charter.md`.


📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Per-agent model selection implemented with cost-first directive (optimize cost unless writing code) — decided by Brady and Verbal

📌 Team update (2026-02-11): Discord is the v0.3.0 MVP messaging connector. Gateway must be platform-agnostic with zero GitHub-specific imports. — decided by Keaton


📌 Team update (2026-02-11): MCP Integration Direction for Squad approved — Option B (Awareness Layer) chosen. Phase 1 spike (WI-1) validates platform MCP support. See decisions.md for rationale and timeline. — decided by Keaton
