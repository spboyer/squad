## What is Squad?

Squad gives you an AI development team through GitHub Copilot. Describe what you're building. Get a team of specialists — frontend, backend, tester, lead — that live in your repo as files. They persist across sessions, learn your codebase, share decisions, and get better the more you use them.

It's not a chatbot wearing hats. Each team member runs in its own context, reads only its own knowledge, and writes back what it learned.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create your project

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git init
```

### 2. Install Squad

```bash
npx github:bradygaster/squad
```

### 3. Open Copilot and go

```
copilot
```

Select **Squad** from the `/agents` list, then:

```
I'm starting a new project. Set up the team.
Here's what I'm building: a recipe sharing app with React and Node.
```

Squad proposes a team — each member named from a persistent thematic cast. You say **yes**. They're ready.

---

## Agents Work in Parallel — You Catch Up When You're Ready

Squad doesn't work on a human schedule. When you give a task, the coordinator launches every agent that can usefully start — simultaneously. Frontend, backend, tests, architecture — all at once.

```
You: "Team, build the login page"

  🏗️ Lead — analyzing requirements...          ⎤
  ⚛️ Frontend — building login form...          ⎥ all launched
  🔧 Backend — setting up auth endpoints...     ⎥ in parallel
  🧪 Tester — writing test cases from spec...   ⎥
  📋 Scribe — logging everything...             ⎦
```

When agents finish, the coordinator immediately chains follow-up work — tests reveal edge cases, the backend agent picks them up, no waiting for you to ask. If you step away, a breadcrumb trail is waiting when you get back:

- **`decisions.md`** — every decision any agent made, merged by Scribe
- **`orchestration-log/`** — what was spawned, why, and what happened
- **`log/`** — full session history, searchable

**Knowledge compounds across sessions.** Every time an agent works, it writes lasting learnings to its `history.md`. After a few sessions, agents know your conventions, your preferences, your architecture. They stop asking questions they've already answered.

| | 🌱 First session | 🌿 After a few sessions | 🌳 Mature project |
|---|---|---|---|
| ⚛️ **Frontend** | Project structure, framework choice | Component library, routing, state patterns | Design system, perf patterns, a11y conventions |
| 🔧 **Backend** | Stack, database, initial endpoints | Auth strategy, rate limiting, SQL preferences | Caching layers, migration patterns, monitoring |
| 🏗️ **Lead** | Scope, team roster, first decisions | Architecture trade-offs, risk register | Full project history, tech debt map |
| 🧪 **Tester** | Test framework, first test cases | Integration patterns, edge case catalog | Regression patterns, coverage gaps, CI pipeline |
| 📋 **Scribe** | First session logged | Cross-team decisions propagated | Full searchable archive of every session and decision |

Each agent's knowledge is personal — stored in its own `history.md`. Team-wide decisions live in `decisions.md`, where every agent reads before working. The more you use Squad, the less context you have to repeat.

**And it's all in git.** Anyone who clones your repo gets the team — with all their accumulated knowledge.

## How It Works

### The Key Insight

Each agent gets its **own context window**. The coordinator is thin. Each agent loads only its charter + history. No shared bloat.

### Context Window Budget

Real numbers. No hand-waving.

Both Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4 have a **200K token** standard context window. Each agent runs in its own window, so the coordinator is the only shared overhead.

| What | Tokens | % of 200K context | When |
|------|--------|--------------------|------|
| **Coordinator** (squad.agent.md) | ~13,200 | 6.6% | Every message |
| **Agent at Week 1** (charter + seed history + decisions) | ~1,250 | 0.6% | When spawned |
| **Agent at Week 4** (+ 15 learnings, 8 decisions) | ~3,300 | 1.7% | When spawned |
| **Agent at Week 12** (+ 50 learnings, 47 decisions) | ~9,000 | 4.5% | When spawned |
| **Remaining for actual work** | **~187,000** | **93%+** | Always |

The coordinator uses 6.6% of context. A 12-week veteran agent uses 4.5% — but in **its own window**, not yours. That leaves **93%+ of the coordinator's context for reasoning about your code**, and each spawned agent gets nearly its entire 200K window for the actual task. Fan out to 5 agents and you're working with **~1M tokens** of total reasoning capacity — without paying for a larger model.

### Memory Architecture

| Layer | What | Who writes | Who reads |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|
| `charter.md` | Identity, expertise, voice | Squad (at init) | The agent itself |
| `history.md` | Project-specific learnings | Each agent, after every session | That agent only |
| `decisions.md` | Team-wide decisions | Any agent | All agents |
| `log/` | Session history | Scribe | Anyone (searchable archive) |

## What Gets Created

```
.ai-team/
├── team.md              # Roster — who's on the team
├── routing.md           # Routing — who handles what
├── decisions.md         # Shared brain — team decisions
├── casting/
│   ├── policy.json      # Casting configuration
│   ├── registry.json    # Persistent name registry
│   └── history.json     # Universe usage history
├── agents/
│   ├── {name}/          # Each agent gets a persistent cast name
│   │   ├── charter.md   # Identity, expertise, voice
│   │   └── history.md   # What they know about YOUR project
│   ├── {name}/
│   │   ├── charter.md
│   │   └── history.md
│   └── scribe/
│       └── charter.md   # Silent memory manager
└── log/                 # Session history
```

**Commit this folder.** Your team persists. Names persist. Anyone who clones gets the team — with the same cast.

## Growing the Team

### Adding Members

```
> I need a DevOps person.
```

Squad generates a new agent, seeds them with project context and existing decisions. Immediately productive.

### Removing Members

```
> Remove the designer — we're past that phase.
```

Agents aren't deleted. Their charter and history move to `.ai-team/agents/_alumni/`. Knowledge preserved, nothing lost. If you need them back later, they remember everything.

---

## Reviewer Protocol

Team members with review authority (Tester, Lead) can **reject** work. On rejection, the reviewer may require:

- A **different agent** handles the revision (not the original author)
- A **new specialist** is spawned for the task

The Coordinator enforces this. No self-review of rejected work.

## What's New in v0.2.0

- [**Export & Import CLI**](docs/features/export-import.md) — Portable team snapshots for moving squads between repos
- [**GitHub Issues Mode**](docs/features/github-issues.md) — Issue-driven development with `gh` CLI integration
- [**PRD Mode**](docs/features/prd-mode.md) — Product requirements decomposition into work items
- [**Human Team Members**](docs/features/human-team-members.md) — Mixed AI/human teams with routing
- [**Skills System**](docs/features/skills.md) — Earned knowledge with confidence lifecycle
- [**Tiered Response Modes**](docs/features/response-modes.md) — Direct/Lightweight/Standard/Full response depth
- [**Smart Upgrade**](docs/scenarios/upgrading.md) — Version-aware upgrades with migrations

---

## Install

```bash
npx github:bradygaster/squad
```

See [Quick Start](#quick-start) for the full walkthrough.

### Upgrade

Already have Squad? Update Squad-owned files to the latest version without touching your team state:

```bash
npx github:bradygaster/squad upgrade
```

This overwrites `squad.agent.md` and `.ai-team-templates/`. It never touches `.ai-team/` — your team's knowledge, decisions, and casting are safe.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Experimental** — API and file formats may change between versions
- **Node 22+** — requires Node.js 22.0.0 or later (`engines` field enforced)
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** — Squad runs on GitHub Copilot; no other runtimes are supported
- **Knowledge grows with use** — the first session is the least capable; agents improve as they accumulate history

---

## Status

🟣 **Experimental** — v0.2.0. Contributors welcome.

Conceived by [@bradygaster](https://github.com/bradygaster).
