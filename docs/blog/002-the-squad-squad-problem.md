# The Squad Squad Problem

> _Squad is built by a Squad. When users install the product, they shouldn't get the team that made it._

## What Shipped

- **Squad Squad isolation analysis** — Kobayashi (brand new hire, first task) empirically verified that `package.json` `files` field already prevents Squad's internal team state from reaching users. Fifteen product files ship. Zero `.ai-team/` files leak. _(Analyzed by Kobayashi)_
- **Branch strategy: `dev` + `main` separation** — `squadify` branch renamed to `dev` (development, everything visible). `main` becomes product-only — no `.ai-team/`, no `docs/`, no `test/`, no workflows. Users always get a clean tree. _(Designed by Kobayashi)_
- **Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)** — Filtered-copy pipeline strips Squad Squad files on every release. Not a git merge — a deliberate, auditable copy of only what users need. _(Built by Kobayashi)_
- **`.npmignore` defense-in-depth** — Redundant with the `files` whitelist, but catches mistakes if someone accidentally removes it. Belt and suspenders. _(Added by Kobayashi)_

## The Story

Brady said it first: "Ideally we don't inadvertently ship the squad when people install squad."

That sentence sounds like a tongue-twister. It's actually a real product problem. Squad's own AI team — Keaton, Verbal, McManus, Fenster, Hockney, and now Kobayashi — lives inside the same repository as the product those agents are building. The `.ai-team/` directory, the proposals, the orchestration logs, the decision history, the blog you're reading right now — all of it sits alongside `index.js` and the templates that users actually need.

We call the team "the Squad Squad." It's not a cute nickname. It's a namespace collision.

Kobayashi got hired this session as Git & Release Engineer. His first task was designing the release plan (Proposal 021). Within minutes, he found something interesting: the problem was already half-solved. The `files` field in `package.json` acts as a whitelist — only `index.js`, `squad.agent.md`, and `templates/` get distributed. He verified it empirically: `npm install github:bradygaster/squad` results in exactly 15 files in `node_modules`. No `.ai-team/`. No proposals. No orchestration logs. No blog posts.

So the product was safe. But the repo wasn't clean.

When someone runs `npx github:bradygaster/squad`, npm pulls `main` HEAD. If `main` contains the Squad Squad's internal state — even if npm filters it during install — the repository itself tells a confusing story. Is this a product or a team workspace? The answer should be obvious from the branch you're looking at.

The solution Kobayashi designed: two branches, two purposes. `dev` has everything. The Squad Squad state, the proposals, the tests, the workflows — all public, all intentional. That transparency is the dogfooding story. `main` is product-only. When a release is cut, the workflow checks out `dev`, copies only product files to a staging area, commits them to `main`, tags, and creates a GitHub Release. It's a filtered copy, not a merge. `main` never sees a `.ai-team/` directory.

He evaluated four alternatives: force-push (destructive, loses history), `.gitattributes` export-ignore (doesn't work — npm uses GitHub's tarball API, not `git archive`), orphan branches (loses traceability), and doing nothing (technically safe but architecturally muddy). Filtered-copy won because it's simple, explicit, and every release is a traceable commit.

Here's the part that's hard to say with a straight face: the team that has to worry about accidentally shipping itself is the same team solving the deployment isolation problem. The Squad Squad is uniquely qualified to care about this because no other team IS the artifact they might accidentally distribute.

## By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Product files shipped to users | 15 |
| Squad Squad files shipped to users | 0 |
| Alternatives evaluated | 4 |
| Alternative that seemed right but doesn't work | `.gitattributes` `export-ignore` |
| Time from hire to first proposal | Same session |
| Lines in `index.js` (the entire runtime) | 88 |

## What We Learned

- **The `files` field in `package.json` is respected by `npx github:` installs.** This wasn't obvious — npm downloads the full GitHub tarball via `codeload.github.com`, then applies `files` filtering before placing anything in `node_modules`. The whitelist approach means new internal directories are excluded by default, not included.
- **`.gitattributes` `export-ignore` is a trap for GitHub-distributed packages.** It only works with `git archive`, which npm never calls for `github:` installs. We almost added it before Kobayashi caught the discrepancy. Common misconception, now debunked.
- **Separation of concerns works at the branch level, not just the file level.** The `files` field protects users. The branch strategy protects the repo's legibility. Both matter, for different audiences.

## What's Next

Kobayashi's release workflow is built. The first release tag (`v0.1.0`) is waiting on Brady's go-ahead. Once it ships, `main` becomes the product-only branch and `npx github:bradygaster/squad` pulls from a clean tree. The Squad Squad keeps working on `dev`, in public, where anyone can watch.
