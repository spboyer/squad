## Branch Model Overview

Squad uses a **three-branch model** for release safety:

| Branch | Purpose | Who Commits | Guard Active? | Files Allowed |
|--------|---------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **dev** | Development — all work happens here | All team members | ❌ No | Everything (`.ai-team/`, team-docs, etc.) |
| **preview** | Staging/testing — validated product only | Release coordinator | ✅ Yes | Distribution files only (`.ai-team/` blocked) |
| **main** | Production — release source for `npx` | Release coordinator | ✅ Yes | Distribution files only (`.ai-team/` blocked) |

**Key principle:** `.ai-team/` (team state) and internal `team-docs/` (except blog) never leave dev. When code ships, it ships clean.

---

## Preview Build Workflow

Purpose: Create a staging environment to test the full release before pushing to production.

### Step 1: Create the Preview Branch

Start on `dev` and ensure you have the latest commits:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

Create a preview branch (or reset if it exists):

```bash
git checkout -b release/preview 2>/dev/null || git checkout release/preview
git reset --hard dev
```

### Step 2: Remove Forbidden Files (Guard Enforcement)

Before pushing to `preview`, remove forbidden paths that the guard workflow will block:

```bash
# Remove .ai-team/ (keep local copy via .gitignore)
git rm --cached -r .ai-team/

# Remove team-docs/ except blog/
git rm --cached -r team-docs/
git checkout HEAD -- team-docs/blog/
```

If nothing was removed, that's fine:

```bash
git status
# On branch release/preview
# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

If there are changes:

```bash
git commit -m "chore: remove forbidden paths for preview branch"
git push -f origin release/preview
```

### Step 3: Verify Guard Passes

The guard workflow (`.github/workflows/squad-main-guard.yml`) runs automatically on any PR to `preview` or `main`. Check the workflow run in GitHub Actions:

```bash
# View workflow runs for the preview branch
gh run list --branch release/preview --status completed
```

Expected output: ✅ All checks pass (no forbidden files found).

If the guard fails, see [Testing the Guard Workflow](#testing-the-guard-workflow) for debugging.

### Step 4: Test on Preview

Push test branches off `preview` and create PRs back to `preview` to validate the release:

```bash
# Create a feature branch off preview
git checkout -b test/release-validation
echo "# Release validation" > RELEASE_TEST.md
git add RELEASE_TEST.md
git commit -m "test: release validation"
git push -u origin test/release-validation
```

Create a PR via `gh`:

```bash
gh pr create --base preview --title "Release validation test" --body "Validate preview build."
```

The guard checks this PR. If it passes, your preview branch is clean.

---

## Pull Request Workflow

### Creating a PR (Feature Work on Dev)

When a feature is complete on `dev`, create a PR for review:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: my new feature"
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
```

Create the PR:

```bash
gh pr create --base dev --title "feat: my new feature" --body "Description of changes"
```

### Reviewing a PR

Reviewers use the GitHub UI or `gh` CLI:

```bash
# View open PRs
gh pr list --base dev

# Review a specific PR
gh pr view 123 --web
```

Comments, approvals, and change requests flow through GitHub. No special commands needed.

### Merging a PR to Dev

Once approved, merge to `dev`:

```bash
gh pr merge 123 --merge --auto
```

This squash-merges the PR and deletes the feature branch. To keep history with merge commits:

```bash
gh pr merge 123 --create-branch-off-target --auto
```

After merge, update your local dev:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

---

## Merging Back to Dev

After a release ships from `main`, sync changes back to `dev` (for docs updates, changelog, version bumps made during release):

### Step 1: Create a Sync PR

On your `dev` branch:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b chore/sync-from-main
```

Merge `main` into the sync branch:

```bash
git merge main --no-ff --no-edit
```

This brings all production commits back to dev, preserving the release tag and history.

### Step 2: Resolve Conflicts (if any)

If conflicts exist, resolve them:

```bash
git status
# Lists conflicted files
git add .
git commit -m "chore: resolve merge conflicts from main"
```

### Step 3: Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin chore/sync-from-main
gh pr create --base dev --title "chore: sync from main" --body "Bring production changes back to dev"
```

### Step 4: Merge Back

```bash
gh pr merge --merge --auto
git checkout dev && git pull origin dev
```

---

## Full Release Lifecycle

Complete journey from feature work to production tag.

### Phase 1: Preparation (on `dev`)

**Time:** Before release day. All features complete, all tests passing.

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md:**

```bash
# Edit CHANGELOG.md with new version entry
# Format: ## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD
# Sections: Added, Changed, Community, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed
nano CHANGELOG.md
```

Example entry:

```markdown
## [0.4.0] — 2026-02-15

### Added
- MCP tool discovery and integration
- Plugin marketplace support
- Notification system (Trello, Teams, GitHub)
- 11 new universes (Futurama, Seinfeld, The Office, etc.)
- Branch protection guard (squad-main-guard.yml)

### Changed
- VS Code support now fully compatible (zero code changes)
- Agent progress signals with [MILESTONE] markers
- Universe count: 20 → 31

### Community
- @csharpfritz: MCP tool discovery (#11), user docs (#16)
- @spboyer: VS Code compatibility (#17)
```

2. **Update version in package.json:**

```bash
# Edit version field
nano package.json
# "version": "0.4.0"
```

3. **Commit to dev:**

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md package.json
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v0.4.0"
git push origin dev
```

### Phase 2: Preview Build (on `preview`)

**Time:** Release day morning. Validate all files before shipping.

Follow [Preview Build Workflow](#preview-build-workflow) above. Summary:

```bash
git checkout release/preview
git reset --hard origin/dev
git rm --cached -r .ai-team/ 2>/dev/null
git rm --cached -r team-docs/ 2>/dev/null
git checkout HEAD -- team-docs/blog/
git commit -m "chore: remove forbidden paths for preview" 2>/dev/null
git push -f origin release/preview
# Wait for guard workflow to pass
```

Check GitHub Actions:

```bash
gh run list --branch release/preview --status completed --limit 1
```

Expected: ✅ All checks pass.

### Phase 3: Merge to Main (on `main`)

**Time:** Release day afternoon, after preview validation.

1. **Create a release PR to main:**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v0.4.0
git merge --no-ff release/preview -m "Release v0.4.0"
git push -u origin release/v0.4.0
```

2. **Create PR for final review:**

```bash
gh pr create --base main --title "Release v0.4.0" --body "Final release PR. Guard enforces file restrictions."
```

3. **Wait for guard to pass**, then merge:

```bash
gh pr merge --merge --auto
```

The guard validates that only distribution-safe files reach `main`.

### Phase 4: Tag the Release (on `main`)

**Time:** After merge to `main`. This triggers the release workflow.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v0.4.0 -m "Release v0.4.0: MCP integration, Plugin marketplace, Notifications"
git push origin v0.4.0
```

Tag format: `vX.Y.Z` (semantic versioning). The version MUST match `package.json` version.

### Phase 5: Verify the Release

The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```bash
# Monitor the release workflow
gh run list --workflow release.yml --status in_progress
gh run list --workflow release.yml --status completed --limit 1
```

Check what the workflow does:

1. Runs full test suite
2. Creates a GitHub Release with notes
3. Validates that only distribution files were shipped

If the workflow fails, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Phase 6: Sync Back to Dev

After release, bring version/changelog updates back to dev:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b chore/sync-from-main
git merge main --no-ff
git push -u origin chore/sync-from-main
gh pr merge --merge --auto
git pull origin dev
```

---

## Branch Protection Rules

The repository enforces protection rules on `main` and `preview` to prevent accidental shipping of forbidden files.

### What's Protected

| Branch | Rule | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| `main` | Require guard workflow to pass | PRs with `.ai-team/` or team-docs/ (except blog) are **blocked** |
| `main` | Require PR review | All PRs require at least 1 approval |
| `main` | Require status checks to pass | Tests must pass before merge allowed |
| `preview` | Require guard workflow to pass | PRs with `.ai-team/` or team-docs/ (except blog) are **blocked** |

### The Guard Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/squad-main-guard.yml`

**When it runs:** On any PR to `main` or `preview` (events: `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`)

**What it checks:**

```javascript
// Forbidden on main and preview:
✗ .ai-team/**          (zero exceptions — team state never ships)
✗ team-docs/**         (except team-docs/blog/**)

// Allowed everywhere:
✓ index.js             (distribution)
✓ squad.agent.md       (distribution)
✓ templates/**/*       (distribution)
✓ docs/**/*            (distribution)
✓ test/**/*            (distribution)
✓ CHANGELOG.md         (distribution)
✓ README.md            (distribution)
✓ package.json         (distribution)
✓ .github/workflows/** (distribution)
```

**Failure behavior:** If forbidden files detected:

```
## 🚫 Forbidden files detected in PR to main

The following files must NOT be merged into `main`.
`.ai-team/` is runtime team state — it belongs on dev branches only.
`team-docs/` internal content should stay on dev (only `team-docs/blog/` is allowed on main).

### Forbidden files found:
- `.ai-team/agents/neo/history.md`
- `.ai-team/decisions.md`
- `team-docs/internal/roadmap.md`

### How to fix:
git rm --cached -r .ai-team/
git rm --cached -r team-docs/
git checkout HEAD -- team-docs/blog/
git commit -m "chore: remove forbidden paths from PR"
git push
```

**Success behavior:** If all files pass:

```
✅ No forbidden paths found in PR — all clear.
```

---

## Testing the Guard Workflow

Verify the guard blocks forbidden files. Use a sacrificial PR.

### Test 1: Verify Guard Blocks .ai-team/

1. **Create a test branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b test/guard-ai-team-block
```

2. **Add a fake .ai-team/ file:**

```bash
mkdir -p .ai-team/agents/test
echo "test content" > .ai-team/agents/test/history.md
git add .ai-team/agents/test/history.md
git commit -m "test: add .ai-team/ file to verify guard blocks it"
git push -u origin test/guard-ai-team-block
```

3. **Create PR to main:**

```bash
gh pr create --base main --title "test: guard should block .ai-team/" \
  --body "This PR tests that the guard blocks .ai-team/ files"
```

4. **Check the PR status:**

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER>
# or view in browser
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --web
```

Expected: ❌ Guard workflow reports forbidden files. PR cannot merge until `.ai-team/` is removed.

5. **Clean up the PR:**

```bash
git rm --cached -r .ai-team/
git commit -m "fix: remove .ai-team/ file"
git push
```

Expected: ✅ Guard workflow passes. PR is now mergeable.

6. **Delete the branch:**

```bash
gh pr close --delete-branch
git checkout dev && git branch -D test/guard-ai-team-block
```

### Test 2: Verify Guard Blocks Internal team-docs/

1. **Create a test branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b test/guard-team-docs-block
```

2. **Add an internal team-docs file:**

```bash
mkdir -p team-docs/internal
echo "internal roadmap" > team-docs/internal/roadmap.md
git add team-docs/internal/roadmap.md
git commit -m "test: add internal team-docs/ file"
git push -u origin test/guard-team-docs-block
```

3. **Create PR to preview:**

```bash
gh pr create --base preview --title "test: guard should block team-docs/internal/" \
  --body "This PR tests that the guard blocks internal team-docs/ files"
```

Expected: ❌ Guard blocks `team-docs/internal/roadmap.md`.

4. **Clean up:**

```bash
git rm --cached -r team-docs/internal/
git commit -m "fix: remove internal team-docs/"
git push
```

Expected: ✅ Guard passes.

5. **Delete the branch:**

```bash
gh pr close --delete-branch
```

### Test 3: Verify Guard Allows team-docs/blog/

1. **Create a test branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b test/guard-allows-blog
```

2. **Add a blog file:**

```bash
mkdir -p team-docs/blog
echo "# My Blog Post" > team-docs/blog/my-post.md
git add team-docs/blog/my-post.md
git commit -m "test: add blog post (should be allowed)"
git push -u origin test/guard-allows-blog
```

3. **Create PR to main:**

```bash
gh pr create --base main --title "test: guard should allow team-docs/blog/" \
  --body "This PR tests that blog files are allowed"
```

Expected: ✅ Guard passes. `team-docs/blog/` is allowed on main.

4. **Delete the branch:**

```bash
gh pr close --delete-branch
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Guard Workflow Failed — Forbidden Files Detected

**Error message:** `🚫 Forbidden files detected in PR to main`

**Cause:** You have `.ai-team/` or internal `team-docs/` files in the PR.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Remove .ai-team/ (keeps local copy)
git rm --cached -r .ai-team/

# Remove internal team-docs/ (keeps blog)
git rm --cached -r team-docs/
git checkout HEAD -- team-docs/blog/

# Commit and push
git commit -m "chore: remove forbidden paths"
git push
```

The guard will re-run automatically. Wait for ✅ pass.

---

### Issue: SSH Hangs During Push

**Symptom:** `git push` hangs indefinitely.

**Cause:** SSH authentication timeout or network issue.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Try with HTTP instead (if you have auth configured)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/bradygaster/squad.git
git push origin <branch>

# Or explicitly use SSH with a shorter timeout
GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -v" git push origin <branch>

# If still stuck, check your SSH key
ssh -T git@github.com
```

---

### Issue: .ai-team/ Files Keep Getting Committed

**Symptom:** `.ai-team/` shows as untracked but somehow appears in commits.

**Cause:** Files were previously tracked (added with `git add -f` before `.gitignore` was updated).

**Fix:** Remove tracked copies permanently (one time per repo):

```bash
# Remove .ai-team/ from git tracking
git rm --cached -r .ai-team/

# Verify .gitignore has .ai-team/
grep ".ai-team" .gitignore

# If not, add it
echo ".ai-team/" >> .gitignore

# Commit
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: ensure .ai-team/ is untracked"
git push origin dev
```

---

### Issue: Missing Workflows in .github/workflows/

**Symptom:** Guard workflow doesn't exist or other Squad workflows missing.

**Cause:** Workflows not installed during Squad init, or accidentally deleted.

**Fix:** Re-run upgrade to restore workflows:

```bash
npx github:bradygaster/squad upgrade
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "chore: restore Squad workflows"
git push origin dev
```

Available Squad workflows:
- `squad-main-guard.yml` — Blocks forbidden files from main/preview
- `squad-heartbeat.yml` — Ralph's periodic triage and labeling
- `squad-issue-assign.yml` — Auto-assign labeled issues
- `squad-label-enforce.yml` — Enforce label namespace integrity
- `squad-triage.yml` — Triage unlabeled issues
- `sync-squad-labels.yml` — Sync static label definitions

---

### Issue: GitHub Release Not Created After Tag

**Symptom:** Tag pushed but no GitHub Release appears.

**Cause:** Release workflow failed, or release already exists for that tag.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow release.yml --status completed --limit 1

# View the latest run details
gh run view <RUN_ID>

# If the workflow failed, check logs
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log

# If no release exists, create manually
gh release create v0.4.0 --title "v0.4.0" \
  --notes-file CHANGELOG.md

# To set as prerelease (for 0.x versions)
gh release create v0.4.0 --title "v0.4.0" --prerelease \
  --notes-file CHANGELOG.md
```

---

## Sample Prompts

Use these with Kobayashi or in Copilot sessions to guide release work.

### To Prepare for Release

```
Kobayashi, prepare v0.4.0 for release:
1. Update CHANGELOG.md with the new version entry
2. Update version in package.json
3. Commit both changes to dev branch

Use these features as the new entry:
- MCP tool discovery and integration
- Plugin marketplace support
- Notification system
- 11 new universes
- Branch protection guard
```

### To Build a Preview

```
Kobayashi, build a preview branch:
1. Create release/preview branch from dev
2. Remove .ai-team/ and team-docs/ (except blog)
3. Commit the removal
4. Push to origin
5. Wait for guard workflow to pass
6. Confirm the guard result
```

### To Tag a Release

```
Kobayashi, tag the release:
1. Checkout main
2. Create and push tag v0.4.0
3. Verify the release workflow starts
4. Report when it completes
```

### To Sync After Release

```
Kobayashi, sync main back to dev:
1. Create a chore/sync-from-main branch
2. Merge main into it
3. Create and merge PR back to dev
4. Confirm dev is up to date
```

### To Test the Guard

```
Kobayashi, test the guard workflow:
1. Create a test branch test/guard-ai-team-block
2. Add .ai-team/agents/test/history.md with dummy content
3. Commit and push
4. Create PR to main
5. Report the guard result (should fail)
6. Remove the file and push again
7. Report the final guard result (should pass)
8. Clean up the branch
```

### To Fix a Blocked PR

```
Kobayashi, fix this blocked PR:
1. Fetch the current PR state
2. Remove all .ai-team/ and team-docs/ files
3. Keep team-docs/blog/ if it exists
4. Commit the removal
5. Push to update the PR
6. Wait for guard to pass
```

## Key Files Reference

- **Guard workflow:** `.github/workflows/squad-main-guard.yml`
- **Release workflow:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` (if it exists)
- **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Distribution config:** `package.json` (version, files array)
- **Ignore rules:** `.gitignore`, `.npmignore`, `.gitattributes`
- **Branch protection settings:** GitHub repo Settings → Branches
- **Distributed via:** `npx github:bradygaster/squad`

---

## Tips

- **Preview is your staging environment.** Test everything there before merging to main.
- **Guard is your safety net.** Let it block forbidden files—it's preventing distribution corruption.
- **`.ai-team/` never leaves dev.** It's runtime state, not product.
- **Tag from main only.** This is your single source of truth for releases.
- **Version in package.json must match git tag.** Keep them in sync.
- **Communicate releases.** Update team.md, decisions.md, and CHANGELOG.md before shipping.
- **Use `gh` CLI for everything.** It's faster and more reliable than web UI for scripting.
