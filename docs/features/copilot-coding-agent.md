# Copilot Coding Agent (@copilot)

Add the GitHub Copilot coding agent to your Squad as an autonomous team member. It picks up issues, creates branches, and opens PRs — all without a Copilot chat session.

---

## Prerequisites

Before enabling @copilot on your Squad, ensure:

1. **Copilot coding agent is enabled** on the repository (Settings → Copilot → Coding agent)
2. **`copilot-setup-steps.yml`** exists in `.github/` (defines the agent's environment)
3. **GitHub Actions** are enabled on the repository

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Add @copilot to your squad with auto-assign
npx github:bradygaster/squad copilot --auto-assign

# 2. Create a classic PAT for auto-assignment (see below)
#    https://github.com/settings/tokens/new → check "repo" scope

# 3. Add the PAT as a repo secret
gh secret set COPILOT_ASSIGN_TOKEN

# 4. Commit and push
git add .github/ .ai-team/ && git commit -m "feat: add copilot to squad" && git push

# 5. Test — label any issue with squad:copilot
```

---

## Enabling @copilot

### In conversation (recommended)

Say something like:
- **"I want to add copilot to the squad"**
- **"hire copilot to the squad"**
- **"add team member copilot"**

The coordinator will add @copilot to the roster and ask about auto-assign.

> **Note:** If your project has features named "copilot" (e.g., a Copilot extension), the coordinator may misinterpret the phrase as project work. Use the CLI fallback in that case.

### During team setup (new projects)

Squad asks if you want to include the coding agent during `init`. Say **yes** and it's added to the roster with a default capability profile.

### Via CLI (fallback)

```bash
# Add @copilot to the team
npx github:bradygaster/squad copilot

# Add with auto-assign enabled
npx github:bradygaster/squad copilot --auto-assign

# Remove from the team
npx github:bradygaster/squad copilot --off
```

---

## COPILOT_ASSIGN_TOKEN (required for auto-assign)

The `squad-issue-assign` workflow needs a **classic Personal Access Token** to assign `copilot-swe-agent[bot]` to issues. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot do this.

### Create the token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. **Note:** `squad-copilot-assign`
3. **Expiration:** 90 days (or your preference)
4. **Scopes:** check **`repo`** (full control of private repositories)
5. Click **Generate token**

### Add as repo secret

```bash
gh secret set COPILOT_ASSIGN_TOKEN --repo owner/repo
```

> **Why a classic PAT?** Fine-grained PATs return `403 Resource not accessible` for this endpoint. The REST API for assigning `copilot-swe-agent[bot]` requires a classic PAT with `repo` scope. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` silently ignores the assignment.

## How @copilot Differs from Other Members

| | AI Agent | Human Member | @copilot |
|---|----------|-------------|----------|
| Badge | ✅ Active | 👤 Human | 🤖 Coding Agent |
| Name | Cast from universe | Real name | Always "@copilot" |
| Charter | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ (uses `copilot-instructions.md`) |
| Works in session | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ (asynchronous via issue assignment) |
| Spawned by coordinator | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Creates PRs | Via session commands | Outside Squad | Autonomously |

---

## Capability Profile

The capability profile in `team.md` defines what @copilot should and shouldn't handle:

| Tier | Meaning | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| 🟢 **Good fit** | Route automatically | Bug fixes, test coverage, lint fixes, dependency updates, small features, docs |
| 🟡 **Needs review** | Route to @copilot but flag for PR review | Medium features with specs, refactoring with tests, API additions |
| 🔴 **Not suitable** | Route to a squad member instead | Architecture, multi-system design, security-critical, ambiguous requirements |

The profile is editable. The Lead can suggest updates based on experience:

```
> @copilot nailed that refactoring — bump refactoring to good fit
> That API change needed too much context — keep multi-endpoint work at not suitable
```

---

## Auto-Assign Flow

When the `squad:copilot` label is added to an issue:

1. **Step 1** — Workflow posts a routing comment (uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
2. **Step 2** — Workflow assigns `copilot-swe-agent[bot]` to the issue (uses `COPILOT_ASSIGN_TOKEN`)
3. **Step 3** — Coding agent picks up the issue, creates a `copilot/*` branch, and opens a draft PR

The workflow automatically detects the repo's default branch (`main`, `master`, etc.).

---

## Lead Triage

The Lead evaluates every issue against @copilot's capability profile during triage:

1. **Good fit?** → Routes to @copilot with reasoning
2. **Needs review?** → Routes to @copilot, flags for squad member PR review
3. **Not suitable?** → Routes to the right squad member, explains why not @copilot

The Lead can also suggest reassignment in either direction:

```
> This test coverage task could go to @copilot — want me to reassign?
> @copilot might struggle with this — suggesting we reassign to Ripley.
```

---

## Labels

When @copilot is on the team, the `sync-squad-labels` workflow creates:

| Label | Color | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `squad:copilot` | 🟢 Green | Assigned to @copilot for autonomous work |

This works alongside the existing `squad` (triage) and `squad:{member}` labels.

---

## copilot-instructions.md

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file gives the coding agent context about your Squad when it works autonomously. It tells @copilot to:

- Read `team.md` for roster and capability profile
- Read `routing.md` for work routing rules
- Check its capability profile before starting (and request reassignment if the issue doesn't match)
- Follow the `squad/{issue}-{slug}` branch naming convention
- Write decisions to the inbox for the Scribe to merge

This file is **upgraded automatically** when you run `squad upgrade` and `@copilot` is on your team — even if Squad is already up to date. If @copilot is not enabled, the file is left untouched.

---

## Tips

- Start conservative with the capability profile and expand as you see what @copilot handles well.
- Use auto-assign for repos where you want fully autonomous issue processing.
- The coding agent works great alongside [issue-driven development](../scenarios/issue-driven-dev.md) — label issues `squad` and the Lead + @copilot handle the rest.
- @copilot's PRs go through normal review — treat them like any team member's work.
